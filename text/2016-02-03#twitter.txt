Dr. Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies."  â†—
Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!  â†—
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!  â†—
This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote. #CruzFraud  â†—
I will be interviewed on  at 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!   â†—
Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.  â†—
And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!  â†—
The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud  â†—
Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.  â†—
During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that  was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.  â†—
Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!  â†—
Great job on  tonight   begged us for a job. We said no and she went hostile. A real dummy!   â†—
