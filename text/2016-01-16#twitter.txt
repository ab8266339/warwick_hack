 Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.  ↗
 Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?  ↗
 Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite  ↗
 Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you!  ↗
 Greatly dishonest of  to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St  ↗
 When will  give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.  ↗
 Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!  ↗
 If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?  ↗
 Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes.  ↗
 Great new numbers. Thank you!  ↗
 Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!  ↗
 Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?  ↗
 Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.  ↗
 The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!  ↗
 Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!  ↗
 Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable  ↗
 Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so  ↗
