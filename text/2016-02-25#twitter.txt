 Thank you Illinois! #Trump2016  ↗
 Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night! #MakeYoutubeGreatAgain #Trump2016  ↗

 Why doesn’t  just endorse  already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!  ↗
 Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!  ↗
