 Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't!  ↗
 Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you!  ↗
 Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses!  ↗
 Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors & special ints  ↗
 Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE ERICA GREAT AGAIN!  ↗
 I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!  ↗
 This shows what a complete & total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really?  ↗
 "   Jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby!"  ↗
 Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot,  only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke!  ↗
 "  you crushed the debate! Thank you!  ↗
  ↗
 Hey - see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing!  ↗
   ↗
 All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest!  ↗
 How can  beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!  ↗
 Thank you! I miss my father.  ↗
 Lightweight  said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie!  ↗
