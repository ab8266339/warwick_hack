Jeb’s policies in Florida helped lead to its almost total collapse. Right after he left he went to work for Lehman Brothers—wow!  ↗
The lobbyists & special interests have just put out an ad for Jeb which hits me "just a little" but is very false!  ↗
I’m self funding my campaign but lobbyists & special interests for Jeb & others are starting to do big ads—desperate! Don’t believe them.  ↗
Wake up Jeb supporters!  ↗
