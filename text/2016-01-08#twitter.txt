Love seeing union & non-union members alike are defecting to Trump. I will create jobs like no one else. Their #Dem leaders can’t compete!  ↗
I hope all workers demand that their  reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!  ↗
On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!  ↗
Not good news for Jeb Bush  ↗
Hank Greenberg, formerly of AIG, gave $10 million to the  campaign 3 months ago. He is not happy, a total waste of money!  ↗
