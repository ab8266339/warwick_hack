 Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE ERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!  ↗
 . Great job on  today. Very wise indeed!  ↗
 . Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps  will do better next year-but doubt it!  ↗
 "   should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story" True, a total distortion of the facts!  ↗
 I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE ERICA GREAT AGAIN!  ↗
 . and  very dishonest in not showing the new  Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!  ↗
 Why isn't  using the much newer  Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!  ↗
 Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!  ↗
 Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly  ↗
 Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing  are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!  ↗
 Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past  in the new  Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!  ↗
 In the ridiculous  ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!  ↗
 Poor  spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!  ↗
 "  Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail  ↗
 A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Story:  ↗
 "  why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."  ↗
