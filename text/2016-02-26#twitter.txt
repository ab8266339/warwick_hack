 They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!  ↗
 Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.  ↗
 Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!  ↗
 Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!  ↗
 Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!  ↗
 Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!  ↗
 Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!  ↗
 Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!  ↗
 I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!  ↗
