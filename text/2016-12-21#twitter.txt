 I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing. Very impressive people!  ↗
 I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss!  ↗
 I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently  ↗
 Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote. Hillary focused on the wrong states!  ↗
