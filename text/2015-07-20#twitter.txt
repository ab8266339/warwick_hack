 I will be interviewed on  tonight at 8:00. Will be talking about the poor treatment of our veterans, illegal immigration, etc.  ↗
 Look how small the pages have become . Looks like a tabloid—saving money I assume!  ↗
 This story is no longer about John McCain, it’s about our horribly treated vets. Illegals are treated better than our wonderful veterans.  ↗
 It was only after I informed NBC that I wouldn't do the Apprentice that they became upset w/ me. They couldn’t care less about “inclusion"  ↗
 "  I agree 100%. McCain is fighting for illegal immigrant but never did anything for our Vets."  ↗
 "      ...rest of GOP only cries but Trump gets stuff DONE"  ↗
 "  the left is petrified of you! Why else would they be attacking you so vigorously?"  ↗
 "   Trump already hosts vets at his resorts. What does Hillary do?"  ↗
 " Trump says things that no one else would even consider saying, I agree with him on the immigration situation, i love honesty"  ↗
 " I believe we have passed that point. There are Homeless Veterans in USA & yet Illegal Aliens get Government Housing"  ↗
 "  hosts events around the #USA 4our #Veterans. Long before a presidential run. He loves our military."  ↗
 " This is big criticism of the Republican field. Speak truth and stop being so PC. This is why  resonates!"  ↗
 "  At least we're talking about the #VA! We weren't a month ago!  "  ↗
 We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.  ↗
 The ever dwindling  which is worth about 1/10 of what it was purchased for, is always hitting me politically. Who cares!  ↗
