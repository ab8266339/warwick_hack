 Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.  ↗
 Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!  ↗
 Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!  ↗
 I will be doing the  with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.  ↗
