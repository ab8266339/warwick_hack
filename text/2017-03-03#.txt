My aunt came to me today asking if I would like help getting started on a hormone replacement to start my transformation. It's something I think about all the time. I shouldn't be nervous and means I would become who I want to be. It's just the starting over after i start living life as a woman that makes me nervous. Could I make a life as a woman. Starting fresh in the world. Would I be laughed at and made fun or would I be treated like a woman. If I started changes wouldn't happen overnight. I would still do the same routine I do now. It would take years to complete. It's a life altering decision and now it's so real. It's actually possible not just a dream.
