 THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN  ↗
 Joe McQuaid () of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical.  ↗
 The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.  ↗
 Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid () of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!  ↗
 I hope  does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!  ↗
 We need a real President!  ↗
 Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  ↗
 So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done. Run country my way!  ↗
 My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.  ↗
 "Minorities line up behind.....Donald Trump" #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain  ↗
