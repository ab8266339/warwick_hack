 Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet  ↗
 Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!  ↗
 Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!  ↗
