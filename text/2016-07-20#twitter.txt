 STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH  ↗
 The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.  ↗
 Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!  ↗
 In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!  ↗
 Bill Hemmer of  was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.  ↗
 Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!  ↗
