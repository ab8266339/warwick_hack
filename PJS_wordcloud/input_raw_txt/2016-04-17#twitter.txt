 Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association!  ↗
 Thank you, California! Will see you soon!  ↗
 I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie!  ↗
 Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me. I am the one person she doesn't want to run against. Will be such fun!  ↗
 Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!  ↗
 Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.  ↗
 I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island. Big crowd, will be fun!  ↗
