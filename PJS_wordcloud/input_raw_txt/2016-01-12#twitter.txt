 The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!  ↗
 Just found out that  is spending a fortune on Iowa push polls negative to me. Not nice, but OK! New polls are great.  ↗
 The speech is really boring, slow, lethargic - very hard to watch!  ↗
 The Iran deal is terrible. Why didn't we get the uranium stockpile - it was sent to Russia.  ↗
 New CBS poll.  ↗
 Another new Iowa poll just released. Thank you!  ↗
 Such a serious problem for Ted & the GOP. Great doubt, Dems will sue! Let's all work together to solve this problem.  ↗
 On my way to Cedar Falls, Iowa, now. Will be great--I love the people of Iowa!  ↗
 THANK YOU!  ↗
