 Thank you Faith and Freedom Forum & . I had a great time in Iowa today!  ↗
 A great night in Iowa!  ↗

 On my way to Iowa. Will be landing in Des Moines in two hours. See ya!  ↗
 Christians need support in our country (and around the world), their religious liberty is at stake! Obama has been horrible, I will be great  ↗
 If I would have challenged the man, the media would have accused me of interfering with that man's right of free speech. A no win situation!  ↗
 If someone made a nasty or controversial statement about me to the president, do you really think he would come to my rescue? No chance!  ↗
 This is the first time in my life that I have caused controversy by NOT saying something.  ↗
 Am I morally obligated to defend the president every time somebody says something bad or controversial about him? I don't think so!  ↗
