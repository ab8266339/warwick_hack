When I intelligently turned down The Club For Growth crazy request for $1,000,000, they got nasty.What a waste of money that would have been  ↗

Many Super Pacs, funded by groups that want total control over their candidate, are being formed to “attack” Trump. Remember when u see them  ↗
No more Clintons or Bushes!  ↗
Congrats everyone--we topped 4 million today on Twitter--and heading up fast!  ↗

Jeb is spending millions of dollars on “hit” ads funded by lobbyists & special interests. Bad system.  ↗
Yet another weak hit by a candidate with a failing campaign. Will Jeb sink as low in the polls as the others who have gone after me?  ↗
" Only Trump is capable of cleaning up the mess America is in, that's why he has my vote! So true!  ↗
