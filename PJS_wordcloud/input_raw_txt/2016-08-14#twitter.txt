 Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!  ↗
 "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!  ↗
 I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!  ↗
 It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!  ↗
 I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!  ↗
 Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!  ↗
 My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.  ↗
 If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%  ↗
 The failing , which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said  ↗
 The failing  talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!  ↗
