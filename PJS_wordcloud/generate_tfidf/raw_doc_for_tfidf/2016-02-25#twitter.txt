 THANK YOU!  ↗
 FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall. He must apologize! If I did that there would be a uproar!  ↗
 Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!  ↗
 Thank you Illinois!  ↗
 Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night!  ↗
 I'm going to do what  was totally unable to do- WIN!  ↗
 LETS MAKE ERICA GREAT AGAIN! Schedule & tickets:  ↗
 Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?  ↗
 Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!  ↗
 Why doesn’t  just endorse  already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!  ↗
 Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!  ↗
