 I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me.  ↗
 I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair. An Obama pick. Totally biased-hates Trump  ↗
 I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day!  ↗
 I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen. Broke record  ↗
 Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE ERICA GREAT AGAIN!  ↗
 " Trump rallies veterans at annual Rolling Thunder Gathering   ↗
 " how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east."  ↗
 " Trump Supports Rolling Thunder Rally STRONG  So true, and remember the M.I.A.'s!  ↗
 " Donald Trump and Bikers Share Affection at Rolling Thunder Rally  A great day in D.C.!  ↗
 " "Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans."   ↗
 The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate. Nice!  ↗
 In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!  ↗
 Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.  ↗
